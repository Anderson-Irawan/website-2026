                    Furari is a clothing brand aimed towards the local Surabaya market primarily for females between the 16-30 age range. This project started out different from most of my logo & brand work, I was asked to draw a bespoke illustration for clothing merch.
                    <br><br>
                    Furari being a startup needed a brand to launch with. The logo needed to capture the appealing candy-like nature of the merch while also resembling the brand’s primary mascots, adorable creatures.                    </p>

                The concept of cute animals on t-shirts was done countless times before, especially in Indonesia. The approach to this trend is normally falls on either the forestry/jungle side or the domesticated cute side. I knew in order to appeal to audiences, we needed a fresh plan - something that struck the in-between but also added another element.
                <br><br>
                There were now two challenges for me: to incorporate all themes into one mascot and figure how it all makes sense in one brand. I pushed out the sweetest, pleasing visuals and while referencing organic curves to my artwork. I consistently keep in mind of the platform this will be primarily marketed to, Instagram and Facebook.</p>

                        To support the cutesy and approachable theme and goal of the startup, I aimed to go for a candy store sign as the foundation for the logomark. With the brand wanting to also appear slightly & effortlessly luxury, the logomark of choice was a simple freestyle letter - accompanied with Furari’s iconic mini heart of course.
                        <br><br>
                        I created three style variations of the logo and added five different colors variations to go with. Simply put, the brand was effective without overshadowing the mascot. The color palette really needed to encapsulate all the traits a piece of clothing from the business would appear, from very fruity & sparkly colors to the cool & calmer tones.
                        <br><br>
                        With new styles of clothing being launched monthly, the color diversity of Furari was purposely left open-ended. This allows brand to attempt other styles without going off brand entirely. Just like furry animals, you can never predict their next ventures!
